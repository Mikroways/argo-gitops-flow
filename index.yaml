    description: 'Creates an ArgoCD base application to provide a managed namespace
      with some policies applied: - Creates the namespace where resources shall be
      created for a specific   team. - A docker-registry kind Secret so pods can use
      it as ImagePullSecrets. - A ResourceQuota to ensure a controlled resource allocation
      per namespace. - A LimitRange to force each container to set resources when
      they are not set. '

    description: 'Creates an ArgoCD AppProject and a sort of ArgoCD Applications to
      bootstrap a complete environment. The AppProject would set RBAC permissions
      to allow project admin role to manage each ArgoCD resource for this project,
      and a read only role to view each resource and access container logs. This chart
      also create an ArgoCD base application (managed as a chart), and allows bootstrapping
      an ArgoCD application to setup environment resources (as databases) and the
